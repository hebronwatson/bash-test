# bash-test 👨‍🏫
Sometimes, I want to *bash* my against a wall when I'm working with this very jpowerful language, to which I owe so much... I just want to know what to expect... for once... please. So I'm uploading a few tests of bash behaviour in the hopes that it will be useful to myself and others. It may be mostly cathartic for me, though.
